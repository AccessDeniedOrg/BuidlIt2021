## About the Project
_Grant√©Studio_ is centered around using blockchain to create inclusive spaces for under-served populations and industries.We like to think that _Grant√©Studio_ is about art,
artists and an equal world. We have structured our product to reward everyone involved with _Grant√©Studio_ .

The main focus of our product is to incentivize charitable spirit. We have devised a system wherein users who donate beyond a minimum threshold will be rewarded with NFTs 
worth a percentage of their donation. These NFTs can also be decoupled from our website and traded on online marketplaces like OpenSea.

You might wonder from where we will source these NFTs? _Grant√©Studio_ envisions a system wherein we curate a steady stream of NFTs by onboarding artists and allowing them to
mint NFTs on our platform.

At _Grant√©Studio_ we are cognizant of the fact that budding artists struggle with managing marketing and obtaining recognition for their work. We invite such artists to 
collaborate with us in ways which benefit all participants on our platform. For our artists we provide a consistent source of income where they get 10% of the amount 
donated by the user who selects their NFT.

For our charities we have a host of features to ensure that our platform reaches the most marginalised sections of the society. Other than getting 90% of the amount donated 
by the users, _Grant√©Studio_  will divide surplus reserves earned from our model among charities that are unable to meet their target at the end of their campaigns on a first 
come first serve basis. This is done through the Monthly _Grant√©_  List we generate on the admin side of things.
